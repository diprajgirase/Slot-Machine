 # ðŸŽ° Slot Machine Project

This is a simple **Slot Machine Game** created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to spin a set of reels and try their luck at winning points by matching symbols.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- A **Spin** button is available to start the reels.
- When clicked, the reels spin and stop randomly.
- Depending on the combination of symbols, the player can win or lose points:
  - **Big Win**: Three identical symbols.
  - **Small Win**: Two identical symbols.
  - **Loss**: No matching symbols.
- The **scoreboard** tracks the player's score throughout the game.
  
## âœ¨ Features

1. **Randomized Reels**: Each reel spins independently and stops at a random symbol.
2. **Winning Combinations**: Players win by matching symbols across the reels.
3. **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score after every spin.
4. **Reset Button**: Users can reset the game to start fresh anytime.

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements

Here are some additional features I plan to add:

1. **Betting System**: Users can bet points before spinning to increase the stakes.
2. **Sound Effects & Animations**: Add engaging sounds and animations to make the game more fun.
3. **Winning Multipliers**: Certain symbol combinations give extra rewards (e.g., 2x, 3x).
4. **Auto-Spin Feature**: Let the game auto-spin after each round.
5. **Themes**: Different themes for symbols (fruits, numbers, emojis, etc.).
6. **Leaderboard**: Players can save and compare their high scores.
7. **Game Over Mechanism**: Implement a game over feature when the player runs out of points or spins.
