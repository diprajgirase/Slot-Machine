# Slot-Machine
In this project, I created a simple Slot Machine Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The slot machine allows users to spin a set of three reels, each containing a variety of symbols. When the user clicks the “Spin” button, the reels will rotate and randomly stop, displaying a combination of symbols. The goal of the game is to match specific symbols across the reels to win points.

How It Works:
The slot machine consists of three reels, each showing different symbols such as fruits, numbers, or emojis.
There is a spin button that the user can click to start the spin.
When the user spins, the reels animate and eventually stop at a random position.
Depending on the symbols that appear, the user can either win or lose points.
A scoreboard is displayed, tracking the player's current score based on their wins or losses.
Key Functionalities:
Randomized Reel Stops: Each reel stops at random symbols, making the game fair and unpredictable.
Winning Combinations: Specific symbol combinations lead to a win. For example:
Three identical symbols on all reels = Big Win.
Two identical symbols = Small Win.
No match = Loss.
Score Tracking: A scoreboard keeps track of the player's score, increasing it on a win and decreasing it on a loss.
Reset Button: A button to reset the game at any time, allowing the user to restart from scratch.
Additional Functionalities to Add:
Betting System: Allow users to bet a certain number of points before each spin, increasing the excitement.
Sound Effects & Animations: Add sound effects when the reels spin or when a win occurs to make the game more engaging. Include smooth animations for reel spinning.
Winning Multiplier: Add a multiplier feature where certain symbol combinations give extra rewards, like 2x or 3x the score.
Auto-Spin Feature: Allow users to enable an auto-spin option, where the machine spins automatically after each result.
Theming Options: Add different themes (e.g., fruit theme, number theme, or emoji theme) that users can switch between to personalize their experience.
Leaderboards: Implement a leaderboard where users can save their high scores, encouraging competition.
Game Over Mechanism: Set a limit on the number of spins or allow the game to end when the player runs out of points.
By implementing these features, the project can become a fun and engaging slot machine game with dynamic gameplay, keeping users entertained.
